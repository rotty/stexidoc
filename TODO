* Missing features

** DONE Cross-referencing
** DONE Specify extractors in code that defines syntactic extensions

   It should be possible to specify a set of additional extractors for
   each structure that defines new syntax relevant to documentation
   generation. This extended set of extractors would be used for all
   code that OPENs that structure; i.e the set of extractors used for
   generating structure FOO's documentation the union of all
   extractors defined for the structures OPEN'ed by foo.

** TODO Indexing

* Architecture

Replace stdl with a more static data structure, essentially mirroring
what (texinfo reflection) from Guile does.
